title: "Defining Ownership"
---

DevPal allows you to add owners for each API. Clear ownership is important for cutting down the time it takes to resolve particular issues. Users can easily triage or quickly reach out to the owner of the API for any questions about the the API.

The DevPal collectors **automatically** reports fine grained API ownership of both implementations and specifications that it locates across analyzed git repositories.

The owner is responsible for maintaining the particular lifecycle of the API(implementation or specification).
